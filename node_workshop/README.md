# Building a website with Node.js in 20 minutes!

I'm Matt Fewer, a teacher and developer here at <u>SPICED Academy</u>. We are a computer programming bootcamp specializing in teaching Full Stack Development with JavaScript and Node.js.  The courses we currently offer are:

	1. **Full Stack Web Development** [full-time]
	2. **Front End Web Development** [part-time]

If you are interested in learning more information about <u>SPICED Academy</u>, you can reach out to Shilpa (shilpa@spiced-academy.com) or myself (matt@spiced-academy.com).

## A couple of things before we start...

1. We will not spend any time installing/setting up the following. Links are provided for you to install on your own time.
   1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
   2. A code editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
   3. If you have Windows, that you are able to run [Bash](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) in the terminal (Mac people, it's already installed)
   4. [Now](https://zeit.co/now) - provides realtime global deployment for free
2. Q & A - I will take questions as I go through the demo. If need be, we will "parking lot" certain questions to be discussed at the conclusion of the demo.

## Let's talk about Node.js

From the Node.js wiki:

> **Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment for developing a diverse variety of tools and applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript framework, many of its basic modules are written in JavaScript, and developers can write new modules in JavaScript.

## The steps

1. Create our project directory and all the files we will need.
   1. `index.html` & `server.js`
2. `npm init` your directory
   1. Go into `package.json`, change the start script to `"start": "node --harmony-async-await server"`
3. Create your server.
4. Create your html file.
5. Style it.
6. Deploy using Now.
7. Go brag to all your friend, your website is now live on the internet!
