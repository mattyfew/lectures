        <p>Full-time and part-time programming courses in Berlin. Learn to think critically, communicate effectively and get a career you'll love.</p>

        <p>SPICED Academy is an education startup on a mission to build a global community of well-rounded, creative software engineers. We give students a deep knowledge of coding and all the skills they need to build a lasting, prosperous career. Our goal is to make coding approachable for those who previously felt daunted. Our rigorous courses are project-based and team-oriented to accelerate learning and help our students be ready to excel â€“ confident, prepared, and empowered.</p>
