#LinkedIn

Having a good LinkedIn profile will greatly aid you in your job search as a web developer. On top of your personal website, it is a great resource to direct recruiters and employers to. It should tell a more complete story than your resume, which in the beginning should only be 1 page.

We are going to go through steps to make sure that your LinkedIn is in tip top shape and ready to go when you begin your job search.

* Create a LinkedIn account if you haven't already.


##Your professional headline
This is your h1 tag, your most influential element as far as SEO. In this you should put the position that you WANT to have. So if you want to be a front end developer, you should specifically write "Front End Developer". Some people like to use pipes (||) to seperate distinctions.

##Summary
You need to write a summary about yourself. Yes, it is hard to write about yourself, especially in a professional context (wait until you start writing cover letters!) For SEO purposes, you NEED a summary. Don't forget to drop in some keywords!

Your summary should be a general overview of who you are, what you do for a living, what your values are, what you hope to achieve, what your favorite part of being a developer is, etc. See [this link](http://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2014/09/07/three-steps-to-writing-the-perfect-linkedin-summary/#7b3eba0a5b06) for some tips on writing a summary.

##Your custom URL
Everyone loves a custom URL! This is a nice feature of LinkedIn and you should take advantage of it. This also helps with SEO when recruiters search for your name.

##Your profile picture
Keep it as professional as possible. White backgrounds usually look really nice on LinkedIn. Make sure you are dressed well - it should reflect the job you want to get! A bank will quickly dismiss a profile that has a picture of them in a hoodie. Avoid pictures of you at a party, at a bar, etc.

##Job descriptions
Similar to writing out your resume - you can even use these for your resume bullet points. CONSISTENCY IS KEY!!!! Do NOT have one job with all bullets, one job with a paragraph, one job with no text at all. This looks very bad and will reflect poorly on you.  Be as consistent as possible when writing out your job descriptions. Don't forget to use keywords.

Also don't fluff up content with unneccessary information. Try to keep it results driven and focus on your hard-responsibilities. You want every sentence to convey the responsibility that you had, a successful project you completed, a sales quota you hit, or how many employees you were in charge of.

Tip - something I did was I bought a book of professional resumes that had been compiled. You can buy these books for super cheap used on amazon. This will also come in handy when designing your resume. They also sometimes have cover letters in them as well. You can reference these professionally tailored resumes and cover letters as a template for your own! [I bought this book used for 1 penny + S&H](https://www.amazon.com/Gallery-Best-Resumes-Collection-Professional/dp/159357858X/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1474292648&sr=8-4&keywords=the+best+resumes).

##Skills & Endorsements
This section lays out the hard skills and programming languages you have experience with.  It is also a little-know SEO gold mine! Basically, every single "endorsement" you get is one instance of that word on your profile. So when you have 40 endorsements for JavaScript, the word JavaScript comes up 40 times for search engines.

Tip - Add every programming language that you've used. Avoid fluff skills like "leadership" or "time management" if you can.
Tip - Talk to all of your peers and ask them to endorse every single skill you have, and you will do the same for them. There is no shame in this, as you both benefit. And not to mention having a lot of endorsees looks great on your profile!

##Projects
This is how you will show off your projects! LinkedIn does this a bit oddly...Find the "Add Media" section, add a link to your project, enter the info about your project, and add it to the appropriate position that you did it. This will help your LinkedIn flow like a story and is a great way to showcase all of the websites and media that you worked with. I've added websites, music videos, and published articles I've worked on. Any professional media should go on your linkedIn.

##Groups
Joining relevant groups and participating in their discussions will also boost your SEO. Again, don't spam. Quality over quantity.

##Recommendations
These look excellent on your profile, especially if they are from previous supervisors/bosses from tech related jobs. If you are close with your supervisors, ask them to write a recommendation and submit it on LinkedIn.

Tip - if it makes it easier for them, you can write the recommendation yourself and then send it to them to post on your profile. Obviously you should only ask people you are close with who will write and post excellent reviews of you.

##Adding SPICED
Since you are a student, you should add SPICED Academy as both an education and as experience. I will go over how to do this with you.


##General Tips
* Your LinkedIn should be filled out at nearly 100%. This guarantees that you have the most content you can on there. After all, "content is king."
* **Keywords, keywords, keywords!** - always be using keywords when writing a resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn. This is actually a little easier for developers, as the languages you use (and plan on using) serve as excellent keywords. Never miss an opportunity for using content specific keywords when applying for jobs. It helps more than you know. Many employers use keyword-scanning software that will literally scan your documents for the specific keywords they are looking for. Be sure not to "spam" keywords, use them tastefully. A tip would be to look at the job descriptions of jobs you want to apply to, and try to incorporate keywords from those into your LinkedIn, resume, and cover letter.
* BE CONSISTENT WITH EVERYTHING! Format for projects should be the same - job descriptions, education, media, EVERYTHING. If you end your bullets in periods, ALL bullets should end in periods. If you capitalize the first letter of a bullet, then all must be capitalize. If you write Angular.js when referring to Angular, then you need to write Angular.js for everything. Etcetera, etcetera... 
* Be sure to switch OFF the button for notifying your network of profile changes - especially after you get a job. You don't want your employer or coworkers knowing that you are regularly updating your LinkedIn!
