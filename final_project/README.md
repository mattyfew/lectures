# Final Project

You've made it to the final week!  Take a moment to pat yourself on the back and reflect on all that you have learned in the past 11 weeks.  Now we are going to put that knowledge to the test, as you embark on your final project!

The dedicated project period is known as a **sprint**. The purpose of the sprint is to build your project with a set of required features known.  This "first draft" is referred to as the *MVP*, or *minimum viable product*.  This means that, while the project may not have 100% of the features you wanted to incorporate, the MVP will include all the core functionality your project needs to run.

## Outline

Objective: **Build an original complex full stack application**.

Timeline: The project begins **today** and you will be presenting them on **XXXXXXXX**.

Outline: You will have **XXXXXX** number of days to build a full stack web application. You are free to use any JavaScript library/framework you want, with a preference on the stack that we have taught you (React, Node, etc).  We encourage to get creative with your ideas and think outside the box.

Rules:

1. You can work alone or in pairs.
2. You can use any technology you want, as long as it uses JavaScript.
3. You/your group must use and maintain a remote github repo throughout the project.
4. Your application should be hosted on Heroku.
5. You should be able to talk in-depth about every piece of your code structure.
