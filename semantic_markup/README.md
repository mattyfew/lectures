![html5](https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Badge_256.png)

With the advent of HTML5, we are introduced to a bunch of new, **semantic** tags that help us better organize our HTML code for ourselves, other developers, & web crawlers (for SEO).

There are A LOT of HTML5 elements, many of which you will rarely use, if at all.  Here is a link for a complete list of [new elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff/#new-elements) and everything else about the changes from HTML4 to HTML5.

## The Semantic Elements

**Semantic HTML** refers to strategically using HTML5 elements to reinforce the semantics, or *meaning*, of the info in webpages, rather than merely for presentation.  This makes more sense as you look at the names of HTML5 elements - you can venture a guess as to how that tag would be best utilized.

| Element               | Use                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `<header>`            | Used as a container for introductory content or set of navigation links. Usually contains heading elements (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) as well as a logo. |
| `<footer>`            | Typically used as the footer info of a page, i.e. copyright, sitemap, contact, etc. |
| `<article>`           | Used for self-contained compositions on a page.  Articles usually have their own heading, as well as a footer. |
| `<section>`           | Used for seperating different "sections" of a website.  Note that you should not use a `section` tag if `article`, `aside`, or `nav` is more appropriate. |
| `<nav>`               | The wrapper for your navigation menu.    |
| `<aside>`             | Represents a piece of content that is only slightly related to the rest of the page. |
| `<main>`              | Represents the main content of the body of a document or application. |
| `<audio>` & `<video>` | Used to embed sound & video content.     |
| `<blockquote>`        | Indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Rendered with indentation. |

## Inline Semantic Tags

There are some inline HTML5 elements which will help you define meaning, structure, and/or style to piece of text. Note that some of these tags carry semantic value as well as apply certain styles to your text.

| Element    | Description                              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `<cite>`   | Represents a reference to a creative work. Renders in italics. |
| `<code>`   | Represents some computer code you want to display. It will displayed in monofont. |
| `<em>`     | Marks text that has stress emphasis.  Displayed with italics. |
| `<q>`      | Represents a short inline quote.  Will place text in `" "`. Long quotes should use `<blockquote>` |
| `<mark>`   | Use to place semantic emphasis on content on your page. Used to highlight specific phrases on a page. Renders highlighted. |
| `<strong>` | Gives text strong importance, and is displayed in bold. |
