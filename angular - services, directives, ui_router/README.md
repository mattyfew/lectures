# Angular - Services, Directives,& UI Router

In this lecture we will discuss some more components of Angular.

1. Services
2. Directives
3. Routing
4. A quick sidenote on dependency injection



## Services

Services are JS objects that are able to be shared throughout your Angular app using dependency injection.  Services are designed to provide functionality for parts of your application.  Angular has several built-in services, such as `$http`, `$routeProvider`, and `$scope`.  Notice they all start with `$`. Custom services should **NOT** start with a `$`. They are *singletons*, meaning each service is instantiated only once, and everytime it is used, the singleton is being referenced.  You can think of services as a means of holding functions that you want to be able to use throughout your Angular app. 

### Service vs. Factory vs. Provider

This is often a confusing part of Angular for new devs to wrap their heads around. First thing to remember about this is that they all provide a very similar utility - they allow us to share functions across our app. The main difference is in what manner they share those functions and how they are constructed.

- **Service** - services are instantiated with the `new` keyword, and we attach properties to it using `this`, just as we would when building a constructor.
- **Factory** - the most popular of the three. These return an object in which we attach properties and methods.  
- **Provider** - The biggest difference with providers is that they can be passed into `app.config`, this allows you to alter your provider service before it is made available to your app. The properties/methods you want to be made available to your app must be returned from the provider's `$get` function.

For more info on this subject, check out [this StackOverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15666048/angularjs-service-vs-provider-vs-factory).

For this lecture, we will create a factory that will send a GET request to our server and return the data object:

```javascript
// app/articles/article.factory.js

angular.module('app.factory.articles', [])

.factory('serviceHttp', ['$http', function($http){
    var factory = {
        getArticles: function(){
            var data = $http.get('http://localhost:8080/articles');
            .then(function(result){ return result; },
                  function(err) { alert("Error: No data returned"); }
            );
            return data;
        };
    };
     
    return factory;
}]);

```

We must also include the script in our index.html:

```html
<script src="app/articles/article.factory.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

From here, we can now inject our factory into our controller and then we can use the `getArticles()` function!

```javascript
var TestApp = angular.module("TestApp", ["app.factory.articles"])

.controller('MainCtrl', function($scope, $state, $http, serviceHttp){
    serviceHttp.getArticles().then(function(result){
        $scope.articles = result.data;
    })
});
```

This will run `serviceHttp.getArticles()` as soon as the controller is created and attach the data to our `$scope`.

## Directives

Directives are one of the main features that makes Angular so powerful. It allows us to insert logic in the form of a custom HTML element.  Think of directives as a custom HTML element that you define and then inject anywhere into the DOM, and you can also give it a controller to perform operations.

Angular has many [built-in directives](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_ref_directives.asp).  Examples include `ng-app`, `ng-click`, and `ng-repeat`.

#### Creating a Custom Directive

For this example, we will creative a directive for our navigation bar. The template looks like this:

```html
// app/nav/nav.html

<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Profile</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Settings</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

This is how we define our directive:

```javascript
// app/nav/nav.directive.js

angular.module('app.nav', [])

.directive('spicedNav', function(){
    return {
        templateUrl: 'app/nav/nav.html',
        restrict: 'E'
    }
});
```

Note that when naming your directive, it *must* be written in **camelCase**.  When you inject it into the DOM, you must write it in **train-case**. Angular does all the magic parsing for you.

The restrict property tells Angular which method you will use to invoke your directive (see below). If you wanted to inject any dependencies, you would do so as you normally would in the parameters of the function

Now, we must include it in our master app module:

```javascript
var TestApp = angular.module("TestApp", ["app.factory.articles", "app.nav"])
```

â€¦as well as in our index.html:

```html
<script src="app/nav/nav.directive.js"></script>
```

OK! Finally, we must invoke the directive in our view.  There are 4 ways to invoke a directive:

```html
// custom element (generally the most popular method), restrict: 'E'
<spiced-nav></spiced-nav>

// attribute, restrict: 'A'
<div spiced-nav></div>

// class, restrict: 'C'
<div class="spiced-nav"></div>

// comment, restrict: 'M'
<!-- directive: spiced-nav -->
```

## Routing

Angular 1.5 has two different options for routers: **ng-Route** and **UI Router**.  We will be using UI Router.

## ui.router

UI Router uses states and associates them with URLS, views, templates, controllers, etc. It is slightly more complex than ng-Route, but it is much more powerful because you can load multiple views for each state. Think of each state as a "page" of your SPA.

### The Set-Up

We inject `$stateProvider` which lets us configure our UI Router.  We give the state a name, associate it with a URL, and designate the views that we want to render at the state.

```javascript
// app/routes.js

angular.module('app.routes', ['ui.router'])

.config(function($stateProvider){
    $stateProvider
        .state('home',{
            url: '/',
            views: {
                'main': {
                    templateUrl: 'app/views/main.html'
                }
            }
        })
  
        .state('about',{
            url: '/about',
            views: {
                'main': {
                    templateUrl: 'app/views/about.html'
                }
            }
        });
```

Don't forget to include UI Router and the routes file we've created into our list of dependencies. Angular 1.5 does not come with UI Router built-in.  You must include a link to it in your scripts.

```html
<!-- app/views/index.html -->

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.8/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-ui-router/0.3.2/angular-ui-router.min.js"></script>
<script src="app/nav/nav.directive.js"></script>
<script src="app/app.js"></script>
<script src="app/routes.js"></script>
```

We must also include the ui-view directive into our ` index.html` file so that Angular knows where to load our views & templates.

```html
<!-- app/views/index.html -->

<div id="main-container">
	<gt-nav></gt-nav>
	<div ui-view="main"></div>
</div>
```

In order to be able to link to these states inside of our web app, we need to utilize `ui-sref`. This is a directive that will load the *href* property for us, along with some other angular magic.

```html
<!-- app/views/templates/nav.html -->

<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a ui-sref="home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a ui-sref="about">About</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
```

So, when we click on the link for *about*, our browser will navigate to the URL "localhost:8080/about", and the **about** state will be loaded.

Last but not least, we must inject our routes module into our angular app.

```javascript
var TestApp = angular.module("TestApp", ["app.routes", "app.nav", "app.factory.articles"])
```

## A quick sidenote on dependency injection

In production level apps, it is very likely that you will *minify* your code.  Because of the nature of dependency injection in Angular this causes issues, specifically the renaming of your dependencies. The way around this is actually pretty simple. We use what is called **inline array annotation**. Quoting [this article](http://anandmanisankar.com/posts/angularjs-dependency-injection-demystified/):

> In this approach, instead of just providing a controller function, we pass an array whose elements consist of a list of names of the dependencies followed by the function itself. This overcomes the issues caused with minified JavaScript, by allowing flexible parameter names.

We do this in our factory example above:

```javascript
.factory('serviceHttp', ['$http', 'myOtherModule', function($http, myOtherModule){
    var factory = {
        getArticles: function(){ /* code here */  }
    };
     
    return factory;
}]);
```
